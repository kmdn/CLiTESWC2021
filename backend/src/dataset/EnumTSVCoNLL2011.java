	// mention)

	// - column 4 is the corresponding YAGO2 entity (in YAGO encoding, i.e. unicode
	// characters are backslash encoded and spaces are replaced by underscores, see
	// also the tools on the YAGO2 website), OR --NME--, denoting that there is no
	// matching entity in YAGO2 for this particular mention, or that we are missing
	// the connection between the mention string and the YAGO2 entity.

	// convenience when evaluating against a Wikipedia based method)
	// - column 6 is the corresponding Wikipedia ID of the entity (added for
	// convenience when evaluating against a Wikipedia based method - the ID refers
	// to the dump used for annotation, 2010-08-17)
	// - column 7 is the corresponding Freebase mid, if there is one (thanks to
	// Massimiliano Ciaramita from Google ZÃ¼rich for creating the mapping and making
	// it available to us)
